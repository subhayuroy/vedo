# Jupyter Notebooks

Here you will find a set of notebooks.
It allows to embed a redering window into a jupyter notebook via
[K3D](https://github.com/K3D-tools/K3D-jupyter)
(or optionally with `itkwidgets`, `ipyvtk` or [panel](https://github.com/pyviz/panel)).

On top of this `K3D` allows to export an interactive
[snapshot](https://vedo.embl.es/examples/K3D_snapshot.html)
of the rendered scene.

### note that notebook support (except for `ipyvtk`) is rather limited and not all functionalities are available, in particular:

- axes are very basic
- text2d is not available
- limited possibilities for scene interaction
